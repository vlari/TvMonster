# Description


This is an iOS app created as a Take Home Project for Jobsity. This app shows listing TV series, using the API provided by the TVMaze website. The solution is using SwiftUI 3 following MVVM and container/presentation patterns. Also, using the latest structured concurrency. Core Data was picked as local persistence.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

General Considerations:
- While searching i am using return tap to perform search.
- Demo tested on virtual simulator.
- Distribuition package exported inside dist folder.
- I will appreciate some feedback. Please contact me:
- obed1355@gmail.com

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Considerations for a next iteration of the project:
- Dark theme is suitable.
- Better Images to improve design and better performance.
- Uni test api layer.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

# Features

### All features provided by Jobsity have been implemented in this solution, including bonus features.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Main Features:**

- List all of the series contained in the API used by the paging scheme provided by the
API.
- Allow users to search series by name.
- The listing and search views must show at least the name and poster image of the
series.

After clicking on a series, the application should show the details of the series, showing
the following information:

- Name
- Poster
- Days and time during which the series airs
- Genres
- Summary
- List of episodes separated by season

After clicking on an episode, the application should show the episodeâ€™s information,
including:

- Name
- Number
- Season
- Summary
- Image, if there is one

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Bonus Features:**

- Allow the user to set a PIN number to secure the application and prevent unauthorized
users.
- For supported phones, the user must be able to choose if they want to enable fingerprint
authentication to avoid typing the PIN number while opening the app.
- Allow the user to save a series as a favorite.
- Allow the user to delete a series from the favorites list.
- Allow the user to browse their favorite series in alphabetical order, and click on one to. This fnctionality works when toggling a button next to the async search bar in Home section.
see its details.
- Create a people search by listing the name and image of the person.

After clicking on a person, the application should show the details of that person, such
as:

- Name
- Image
- Series they have participated in, with a link to the series details.

**Extra Features:**

- Added minimal onboarding screen.
